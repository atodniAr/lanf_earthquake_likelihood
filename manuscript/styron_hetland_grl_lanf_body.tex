\section{Introduction}
Low-angle normal faults (LANFs), with dips less than 30$^\circ$, are
well described in the geologic record. They are hypothesized to have
an important role in accommodating large-magnitude continental
extension \citep{howard1987crustal} and crustal thinning
\citep{lister1986detachment}, and their recognition has been one of
the most important developments in tectonics over the past several
decades \citep{wernicke2009detachment}. However, despite widespread
field observations of inactive LANFs, and their central role in modern
extensional tectonic theory, they remain enigmatic and contentious
structures. This is for two reasons: because brittle faulting on LANFs
is in apparent conflict with standard Andersonian rock mechanical
theory as typically applied to the upper crust
\citep{axen2004lanfmech}, and because observations of active faulting
on LANFs is sparse and at times ambiguous \citep{wernicke1995seis}. A
considerable amount of research has been performed to address the
former concern, reconciling LANF slip with rock mechanics \citep [e.g.]
[]{collettini2011lanfmech}. The latter issue, the paucity of definitive LANF
earthquakes in focal mechanism catalogs, has inhibited hypothesis testing of 
LANF fault theory, and has also contributed to a mode of thought where the 
absence of evidence for LANF seismicity is taken as evidence that LANFs
are inactive or aseismic \citep{jackson1987,
  collettinisibson2001}. However, the lack of observed seismic slip on
continental LANFs may be simply due to the rarity of earthquakes on
LANFs, coupled with the small number of potential active structures.

In this work, we choose to directly address the question of whether
the lack of observed large earthquakes on LANFs may be 
interpreted as an indication that
LANFs do not slip seismically, or if it is better explained as an
effect of the small number of active seismogenic LANFs with low moment
accumulation rates (and hence long recurrence intervals). 
We then calculate the maximum likelihood of observing a significant
earthquake on a LANF by treating all potentially active LANFs described in the 
literature as seismically active at their surface dip angles 
throughout the upper crust. %, and displaying typical seismic behavior.
Under these assumptions, we create synthetic earthquake catalogs with
Gutenberg-Richter and `characteristic' frequency-magnitude distributions
based on each fault's geometry and slip rate, and then calculating the
probability of observing earthquakes on each, and any, fault over different
observation windows.

\subsection{LANF Slip, Mohr-Coulomb failure theory, and Seismicity}

Areas of the crust undergoing active extension are generally assumed
to have a subvertical maximum compressive stress.  Mohr-Coulomb
theory, as applied to the crust, predicts that a fault with a typical
coefficient of friction for rocks (0.6--0.8) should lock up if it is
oriented at an angle greater than 60$^\circ$ to the maximum compressive stress,
and new, optimally oriented faults should form \citep{sibson1985}.  Therefore,
for normal faults with dips less than 30$^\circ$, either much lower
fault friction or elevated pore fluid pressure is required for fault slip.

Evidence for seismic slip on LANFs is sparse.  This is partly due to the
ambiguity of the rupture plane in earthquake focal mechanisms, which have a
high-angle nodal plane if they have a low-angle nodal plane.  Without
ancillary information indicating which plane slipped, catalog searches 
cannot yield unique results.  Several collections of normal fault earthquakes
with known surface breaks \citep{jackson1987, collettinisibson2001}, thereby
resolving dip ambiguity, contain no low-angle events, though the collections
are small ($\le$ 25 events).  Some candidate events exist, but they are
undersea \citep[e.g.][]{abers2001} or difficult to verify \citep[e.g.]
[]{doser1987ancash}.


\section{Potentially Active LANFs}

Over the past decade or so, many field studies have found evidence for LANF 
activity in orogens throughout the world. These studies typically find arrays of 
Quaternary normal fault scarps on the fault traces and/or in the hanging walls 
of mapped or inferred low-angle detachment faults \citep [e.g.,]
[]{axen1999baja}. Some studies also have bedrock thermochronology data from the 
exhumed footwalls of the detachments that is suggestive of ongoing rapid 
exhumation \citep [e.g.,][]{sundell2013lunggar}, although this data does not 
preclude a recent cessation of faulting. In some cases, additional evidence for 
LANF activity comes from geophysical data such as GPS geodesy \citep [e.g.,]
[]{hreinsdottir2009altotib} and seismic waves \citep [e.g.,][]{doser1987ancash}.

We have compiled all potentially active LANFs with known subareal
fault traces from a thorough review of the literature, finding twenty
total (Figure~\ref{fig:lanf_map}).  We have then mapped the approximate fault
traces into a GIS file (available at https://github.com/cossatot/LANF\_gis), 
with metadata such as slip rate and source. Though the fault traces of many
LANFs considered here are obscured by vegetation or agriculture, others
display large fault scarps in Quaternary sediments, particularly those in the
dry climates of Tibet \citep[e.g.,][]{styron2013slr, kapp2005nqtl} and the
western US \citep[e.g.,][]{axen1999baja, hayman2003dv}, which are commonly
interpreted as evidence for past seismic slip.  About half are in Tibet,
consistent with hypotheses that LANFs and metamorphic core complexes
form in areas of hot, thick crust \citep [e.g.,][]{buck1991mcc}.  The
rest are distributed through other areas of active continental
extension: the North American Basin and Range, the Malay Archipelago,
western Turkey, Italy, and Peru. Several of the most-commonly cited
candidates for seismically active LANFs were not included because they
do not have a clearly-defined, mappable fault trace, which is
necessary for our earthquake likelihood calculations.  These include the 
submarine core complexes in the Woodlark Basin \citep{abers2001}, the fault
responsible for the 1995 Aigion, Greece earthquake \citep{bernard1997}
and other potential LANFs underneath the Gulf of Corinth, and the
fault responsible for the 1952 Ancash, Peru earthquake
\citep{doser1987ancash}.

\section{Likelihood of observing a LANF event}
\subsection{Rupture Likelihood on Individual LANFs}
To estimate the likelihood of observing a significant earthquake on an
individual LANF over some contiguous time window of length $t$ (in
years), we perform a Monte Carlo simulation in which we create 4000
synthetic time series of earthquakes, with unique values for fault
geometry and slip rate for each time series. Then, for each time
series we calculate the fraction of unique time windows of length $t$
in which an earthquake as large or larger than a given magnitude
occurs.  We take this value as the probability of observing an
earthquake greater than or equal to moment magnitude \emph{M} over
time period $t$.%, which we will refer to in the general sense as
$P(M,t)$.

The geometry for each fault is estimated based on the length of the
fault trace, the dip of the fault, and the estimated seismogenic
thickness or fault locking depth in the area.  The fault is treated as
planar for simplicity of calculations, even though the exposed
footwalls of many detachment faults are highly corrugated.  We
determine the fault length by measuring the approximate length of the
mapped fault trace perpendicular to the assumed extension direction;
for faults that change dip significantly along strike (e.g., the Dixie
Valley fault), we only consider the low-angle segments of the fault.
Values for the dip are taken from the literature in most cases, and
measured of the dip of footwall triangular facets (interpreted as the exhumed
fault plane) from SRTM data otherwise. In all cases, ranges of fault
geometries are considered, encompassing the degree to which the values are 
known. The fault locking depth is assumed to be 10 km in the absence of other
evidence (such as a geodetic study, \citep[e.g.,][]{hreinsdottir2009altotib}).

Slip rates of the 20 LANFs are similarly gathered from the
literature if possible, or given broad ranges if not documented
(e.g., 1--10 mm yr$^{-1}$).  In the Monte Carlo simulation, samples
for slip rate and dip are drawn from uniform distributions defined
by the maximum and minimum values.  Based on field observations,
some faults have dip ranges that go above 30$^\circ$; this study
only considers slip on faults shallower than this, so for these
faults, dip values are sampled from the minimum to 30$^\circ$ and
the resulting probabilities are then multiplied by the fraction of
the dip range that is under 30$^\circ$.

Each earthquake synthetic earthquake sequence is generated by
randomly sampling 50,000 events from either a tapered Gutenberg-Richter (GR)
distribution with corner magnitude $M_c = 7.64$ and $\beta = 0.65$
(from values estimated by \citet{birdkagan2004f_m} for continental
rifts), or a `characteristic' distribution, as it is not known which
distribution best represents normal fault seismicity.  The samples are taken 
from an interval $M = [5.0, \, M_{max}]$, where $M_{max}$ is calculated as the momentmagnitude $M$ resulting from fault slip $D$ = 15 m over a fault of
length $L$ cutting through a seismogenic thickness $z$ at dip $\delta$,
given the relations

\begin{equation}
 M_o = \mu L z D \,/ \, \sin \delta 
 \end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
M = 2/3 \; \log_{10} (M_o) - 6
\end{equation}
where $\mu = 30$ GPa is the shear modulus and $M_o$ is the seismic
moment in N m \citep{kagan2003pepi}.  The `characteristic' distribution has a
large-magnitude mode corresponding to $D$ = 1.5 m on the fault, a typical
slip distance for normal fault events \citep[e.g.][]{caskey1996}.

These calculations rely on two important assumptions that warrant some
discussion.  The first is that each earthquake ruptures the entire
fault patch uniformly.  Though this is highly improbable fault behavior,
the long-term statistical distribution of earthquake recurrence is 
insensitive to assumptions about slip distribution in
individual events: if $n$ different, equal fault patches rupture independently, each requires $n$ times the interseismic strain accumulation time to rupture with
some earthquake of magnitude $M$ versus a single fault rupturing uniformly; 
but on the whole, magnitude $M$ events would happen with the same long-term
frequency.  The next assumption is that earthquakes are ordered randomly and
separated by the time necessary for sufficient strain to accumulate for each
earthquake to occur.  This means that foreshock and aftershock sequences
and other types of event clustering are not taken into account.  However,
the modal inter-event times for earthquakes $\ge M \,6$ or so are greater than
a hundred years for many LANFs [supplemental figure xx], so the ordering of
events does not impact the results, as this is longer than our maximum observation window.  Furthermore, any clustering resulting in
event spacing less than the observation window would decrease $P(M,t)$, and
we are concerned with calculating the maximum $P(M,t)$.

The results for faults with a GR frequency-magnitude distribution
indicate that it is unlikely that any individual fault would have an earthquake
greater than $M \, 5$ in any modeled observation time (up to 100 years).  
As an example, the results for the Panamint Valley fault are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:kongur_all_probs} a and b;
this fault has the $P(M,t)$ of any of the well-studied LANFs.  The
probability of observing a $\ge M \, 6.0$ event on Panamint Valley fault 
is about 0.5 for $t$ = 100 years, and about 0.15 for $t$ = 35 years, which is the length of the Global CMT catalog. 

The results for faults with a characteristic frequency-magnitude distribution
yield much lower $P(M,t)$; this is because the earthquake sequences are 
dominated by large, infrequent events, so the mean and inter-event times for
moderate events are several times greater; a similar result was found by
\citep{wernicke1995seis} based on a simple calculation, assuming perfectly
repeating earthquakes.

\label{fig:kongur_all_probs}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Probability on All LANFs}
To calculate the probability of observing an earthquake over the time
window on any of the LANFs studied, we first assume that seismicity on
each fault is independent and uncorrelated from seismicity on all
other faults. This assumption is likely true for most faults, but may
not be true for some proximal faults (such as the North and South
Lunggar detachments, or the Papangeo and Tokorondo detachments),
though it is unclear how to determine how these faults may interact 
such that an appropriate statistical rule can be chosen.  We
determine the probability for each time window and minimum magnitude
with the equation
\begin{equation}
P_{AT \, or \, LP\, \ldots \, or \, DV} = 1 - (Q_{AT} \cdot Q_{LP} \cdot \ldots \, \cdot Q_{DV})
\label{ProbUnion}
\end{equation}
where $P_{AT}$ is the probability of observing an earthquake on a
single LANF (the Alto-Tiberina fault), and $Q_{AT} = 1 -
P_{AT}$. Equation (\ref{ProbUnion}) is the union of probabilities for
non mutually exclusive random events.

The results of this calculation are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:kongur_all_probs} b.  Unlike the results from a single
fault, the results from all faults show that it is likely that a
significant earthquake on a LANF would be observed over an observation
period of even a handful of years.  For example, if we take \emph{M}
6.0 as the lowest magnitude for which a 40 year global earthquake
focal mechanism catalog is complete [e.g., ref], then the probability
of seeing a significant LANF event is about 0.65, compared to
probabilities of X--Y for the 20 LANFs individually.

Here we need a better introduction to the next section.

\subsection{Possible Effect of Inactive Faults}

Of the faults considered here, several have received little to no
field study, and others have generated conflict in the geologic
literature over whether they are active.  It is possible that these
faults spuriously affect the results, raising $P(M,t)$.  To test this,
we re-run the final calculations, disregarding the Tokorondo and
Papangeo detachments (as they have received no modern field study and
do not have clear Quaternary fault scarps in Google Earth imagery),
and the Kuzey and Guney detachments, as evidence exists that they are
inactive [e.g., refs, G. Axen, personal communication].  Because
smaller faults with lower slip rates do not significantly impact the
results (see Supplementary Materials), we do not leave out other
poorly-studied or contested faults that have hypothsized low
moment-accumulation rates. By ignoring the inactive structures, the
probability of observing a earthquake above M 6.0 drops to X.YX
(Figure \ref{fig:all_probs_no_maybes}).

\section{Discussion}

Our compilation of potentially active LANFs shows that they are fairly
uncommon structures, yet they may still be found in areas of active
extension. Of the 20 LANFs we considered, we find a moderate
likelihood of observing a $\ge M$6.0 low-angle normal fault earthquake
in several decades of observation.  {\bf this sentence later: The
  compilation may serve as a point of comparison for different
  characteristics of active normal faults or LANF geometry, or as a
  reference for any further related study.} Specifically, our results
indicate a 50--70\% chance of observing a moderate to large earthquake
on a LANF over the 40 or so years of global, automated earthquake
focal mechanism determination, assuming that all faults here are
seismically active at their surface dip angles.  This likelihood range
is not sufficient to reject hypotheses that LANFs are seismically
active or inactive. However, these results do provide a quantitative
probabilistic context for interpretations of the lack of
well-documented continental LANF earthquakes.  For example, these
probabilities indicate that it cannot be taken for granted that a
significant earthquake should be observed over a `catalog period' of
about 40 years. Therefore, results and conclusions of studies
analyzing the dip distribution of earthquakes on continental normal
faults \citep{jackson1987, collettinisibson2001} should be interpreted
in this context.  Similarly, mechanisms such as aseismic creep \citep
[e.g.,][]{collettini2011lanfmech, hreinsdottir2009altotib}, isostatic
flexure \citep[e.g.,][] {wernickeaxen1988rolling}, or extremely long
seismic recurrence intervals \citep{wernicke1995seis} need not be
invoked to explain the lack of observed seismicity, though these
mechanisms may indeed be valid or well supported by other
observations.

{\bf I don't think ending on a overly ``discussy'' paragraph is
  effective, rather I think that this should be folded in above, and
  that these are max probs should be stated a few times, at least
  intro and conclusions.:} It should also be noted that this study
gives the \emph{maximum} probability of observing a LANF earthquake
given that these are the only active continental LANFs.  Some of these
faults may be inactive, such as those in Turkey and Sulawesi; though
given that a considerable number of the faults here have been first
described in the past 10-15 years, it is also likely that more
potentially active LANFs will be discovered in the future.  Many of
these faults may have steeper dips in the seismogenic crust, such as
the Ca\~nada David detachment in Mexico \citep{fletcherspelz2009}.
Some of these may also be aseismic; the Alto-Tiberina fault appears to
be creeping for much of its down-dip extent
\citep{hreinsdottir2009altotib}, and the neighboring Zuccale inactive
LANF has fault gouge suggestive of creep
\citep{collettiniholdsworth2004}.
