# Statistical constraints on observing low-angle normal fault seismicity

## Introduction

The recognition of low-angle normal faults, or LANFs, with fault dips < 30 \degrees in the geologic record and their hypothesized role in accommodating large-magnitude continental extension [1] has been one of the most important developments in tectonics over the past several decades.
However, despite widespread field observations of inactive LANFs[2] and their central role in modern extensional tectonic theory[3], they remain enigmatic and contentious structures. 
This is for two reasons: because brittle faulting on LANFs is in apparent conflict with standard rock mechanical theory as typically applied to the upper crust [4,5], and because observations of active faulting on LANFs is sparse and at times ambiguous[6,7].
A considerable amount of research has been performed to the former concern, reconciling LANF slip with rock mechanics.
The latter issue, the paucity of observations, has inhibited hypothesis testing of LANF fault theory, and has also contributed to a mode of thought where the absence of evidence is taken as evidence of absence [8]; alternately, the lack of observed seismic slip on a contintal LANF may be explained by the rarity of seismicity and the small number of potential active structures.
In this work, we choose to directly address the question of whether the lack of observed seismicity may be interpreted as an indication that LANFs may not slip seismically, or an effect of a small sample size of LANFs that show typical seismic behavior.
